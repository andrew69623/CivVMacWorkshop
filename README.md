===============

A small Civilization V launch wrapper that will install mods downloaded from Steam Workshop for Mac OS X.

Subscribe to Civ V mods onthe steam workshop as you would normally, but instead of launching Civ V from within Steam you should launch this application. This application will automatically install all your subscribed Civ V mods before finally launching Civ V for you. Enjoy.
